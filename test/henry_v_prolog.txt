PROLOGUE

Enter CHORUS

CHORUS.
    O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
    The brightest heaven of invention,
    A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
    And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
    Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
    Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
    Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire,
    Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,
    The flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd
    On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
    So great an object. Can this cockpit hold
    The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram
    Within this wooden O the very casques
    That did affright the air at Agincourt?
    O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
    Attest in little place a million;
    And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
    On your imaginary forces work.
    Suppose within the girdle of these walls
    Are now confin'd two mighty monarchies,
    Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
    The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
    Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts:
    Into a thousand parts divide one man,
    And make imaginary puissance;
    Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
    Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth;
    For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
    Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
    Turning th' accomplishment of many years
    Into an hour-glass; for the which supply,
    Admit me Chorus to this history;
    Who prologue-like, your humble patience pray
    Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.
